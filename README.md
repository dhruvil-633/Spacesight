# SpaceSight

**SpaceSight** is a project focused on predicting the collision of satellites or debris with satellites using logistic regression. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient system to anticipate and mitigate potential space collisions.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** SpaceSight
- **Objective:** Predict collisions between satellites and space debris using machine learning (logistic regression).
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Python
  - Flask (Backend)
  - Logistic Regression (Model)
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)

## Progress Updates

### Model Development
- **Started:** Initial phase focused on creating the logistic regression model.
- **Tasks:**
  - Data collection and preprocessing.
  - Building and fine-tuning the logistic regression model.
  - Model evaluation with training and testing datasets.

### Frontend Development
- **Started:** 1 PM, August 8, 2024
- **Tasks:**
  - Designing user-friendly interfaces for input and visualization.
  - Implementing responsive web design for better user experience.

### Integration
- **Started:** Ongoing work to integrate the backend (Flask) with the frontend.
- **Tasks:**
  - Connecting the logistic regression model with the user interface.
  - Ensuring smooth data flow between frontend and backend.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpaceSight.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SpaceSight
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Model:**
   ```bash
   python Model.py
   ```
5. **Run the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. **Run the Frontend (HTML):**
   ```bash
   Open the HTML file in a web browser
   ```

## Future Plans

- Improve model accuracy by experimenting with different algorithms.
- Expand the project to include real-time data processing.
- Implement additional features like alert systems for predicted collisions.
